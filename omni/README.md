# OMNI (Witness + ACIE) — README (v0.01)

OMNI is the witness and intent layer.

ACIE (Authority Capture & Intent Expression) lives in OMNI as a responsibility:
- captures explicit human intent (approvals, delegations)
- produces signed intent artifacts / decision records
- does not execute

Non-goals:
- OMNI does not execute
- OMNI does not orchestrate
- OMNI does not mutate execution evidence
